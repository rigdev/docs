# Getting started

Rig is an application platform for Kubernetes that provides tools to build, deploy, and manage your applications.
It is built on top of our open-source Kubernetes operator, with additional support for running on Docker, intended for local development.

Rig supports deploying any containerized applications. You can deploy already-built applications, or use Rig's CLI to easily develop and deploy your backends.

In this document, you'll learn how to install Rig on **Docker** or **Kubernetes**, set up the CLI, and deploy your first Capsule.

## Install the Rig CLI

The Rig CLI is used to interact with the Rig Platform, both for local development and spinning up a local Rig Platform installation.

      href: "/getting-started/cli-install",
      label: "Install CLI",

      customProps: {

        col: "col--12",
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Install Rig Platform for Local Development

The Rig Platform can run locally in either Docker or Kubernetes. Install the Rig Platform using one of the two guides below:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      href: "/getting-started/platform-installation#option-1-docker",
      label: "Run in Docker",
      description: "Best for rapid local development",
      customProps: {
        icon: "docker",
        col: "col--6",
      },
    },
    {
      type: "link",
      href: "/getting-started/platform-installation#option-2-kubernetes-kind",
      label: "Run in Kubernetes (KIND)",
      description: "Best for imitating production environment",
      customProps: {
        icon: "kubernetes",
        col: "col--6",
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

<hr class="solid" />

## Install Rig Platform on Kubernetes cluster

To install the Rig Platform on your existing Kubernetes cluster, follow the simple guide below.

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      href: "/operator-manual/setup-guide",
      label: "Run in Kubernetes",
      description: "Production environments for real-world workloads.",
      customProps: {
        icon: "kubernetes",
        col: "col--12",
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

<hr class="solid" />

## Deploy your first application

Once Rig is installed, and the initial setup is complete, you are ready to deploy your first capsule. This can be an HTTP server, gRPC server, or something similar that you have built yourself or a Docker image that you want to deploy (like Nginx). Use the [application deployment guide](/capsules/create-deploy) to get started.
