# GitOps

GitOps has become a popular way of managing changes to kubernetes cluster
resources. If you want to know more about gitops, head over to weaveworks and
read about it https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/

The rig platform has initial support for committing the changes it does to
Kubernetes resources to a git repository, instead of actually doing the changes
them. This can be paired with flux or argocd, to have the rig-platform tied
well into your existing gitops workflow.

It is currently not possible to set this configuration directly through the
helm chart, but it can be set if you manually manage the configuration. See the
section about [manual configuration](/operator-manual/secrets).

## Flux

We will soon have a small example repo of how this could look using flux.

## ArgoCD

We will soon have a small example repo of how this could look using ArgoCD.
