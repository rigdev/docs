# Deploy your application to a Capsule using Github Actions
In this document, you'll learn how to build and deploy your application automatically using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have a Rig Capsule up and running, see [Deploy Your Application](/capsules/create-deploy) if not. You should also have a GitHub repository that you would like to build and deploy to your capsule.

## Example workflow using the actions

Rig exposes [two different actions](https://github.com/rigdev/actions), `build` and `deploy`. The `build` action assumes you have a Docker image you want to deploy and makes a Rig build off of it. The `deploy` action can then deploy the previously (or any other) generated build to a capsule.
As you need a Docker image to build and deploy, it is common to prefix these two actions with [Docker Github actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/) to build and publish an image.

The following GitHub workflow example showcases how you can

1. Build a Docker image from a new commit
2. Make a Rig build from that Docker image
3. Deploy that Rig build to your Rig capsule

You can choose your own `buildID` in the `build` action, or if not provided the `buildID` will be the first 10 characters of the Git commit SHA.
