# Capsules

## Overview

Rig comes with a deployment engine that wraps resources in what we call _Capsules_.
A Capsule contains a bundle of resources which will be deployed as a unit. Those resources are

- A Docker image
- Environment variables
- Networking configuration (load balancer/ingress)
- Networking middleware to handle e.g. authentication
- Number of replicas

If you are familiar with Kubernetes, Capsules can be thought of as containing everything (deployment, service, ingress, etc.) needed to run and manage your application.
